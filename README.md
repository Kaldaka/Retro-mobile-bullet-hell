# Retro-mobile-bullet-hell
Self-directed summer coding project

A project originating on Eclipse IDE using Java to create a bullet-hell sytle shooter game destined for mobile. Everything is created from scratch with my current knowledge, or coding "solutions" inspired from online coding forums. The style is retro not only to keep the project simple, but also as an aesthetic choice. The mvp is a PC-playable game which has working ship movement, collision detection, enemy movement, weapon upgrades, and levels containing differing patterns of enemies. From there, cleaning up the code and making it more efficient, and working out major bugs will be the focus. Lastly, porting the game to Android (still using Java) and integrating touch controls and stylus controls will serve as a finish line. May put on play store.

The underlying purpose of this project is to reinforce coding structures and general knowledge before I start school in the fall, as well as to provide a product that will mark the beginning of a portfolio which I will attempt to levy (in part) for employment.
